        <h1>The Best Cricketer In The World:<br><br>Sachin Tendulkar</h1>
        <div>Introduced to cricket at age 11, Sachin Tendulkar was just 16 when he became India's youngest Test cricketer. In 2005, he became the first cricketer to score 35 centuries (100 runs in a single inning) in Test play. In 2008, he reached another major milestone by surpassing Brian Lara's mark of 11,953 Test runs. Tendulkar took home the World Cup with his team in 2011 and wrapped up his record-breaking career in 2013.</div>

    <div><h1>Early Life</h1><h2>Tendulkar was born April 24, 1973, in Bombay, India, to a middle-class family, the youngest of four children. His father was a novelist, writer and a professor, while his mother worked for a life insurance company.
        
        Named after his family's favorite music director, Sachin Dev Burman, Tendulkar wasn't a particularly gifted student, but he'd always shown himself to be a standout athlete. He was 11 years old when he was given his first cricket bat, and his talent in the sport was immediately apparent. At the age of 14, he scored 326 out of a world-record stand of 664 in a school match. As his accomplishments grew, he became a sort of cult figure among Bombay schoolboys.
        Tendulkar finished the 1988‚Äì89 Ranji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth-highest run-scorer overall.</div></h2>
      <div><h1>Cricket Superstar</h1>
        <h2>
        Wasting little time living up to the lofty expectations, the 15-year-old Tendulkar scored a century in his domestic first-class debut for Bombay in December 1988, making him the youngest player to do so. Eleven months later, he made his international debut for India against Pakistan, where he famously declined medical assistance despite getting hit in the face by Waqar Younis.
        In August 1990, the 17-year-old delivered a match-saving 119 not out against England to become the second-youngest player to record a century in Test play. Other celebrated early highlights included a pair of centuries in Australia in 1992, one of them coming at the blindingly fast WACA track in Perth. Underscoring his rapid rise to the top of his sport, Tendulkar in 1992 became the first international player to sign with England's storied Yorkshire club.</h2></div>

        He is the 16th player and the first Indian to score 50,000 runs in all forms of domestic and international recognised cricket (First-class, List A and Twenty20).

        <h1>Remarkable Services</h1>
        <h2>Tendulkar was one of the first nine celebrities appointed by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to spread awareness regarding cleanliness and make Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission) a people's movement.
            The cricketer accepted the nomination and posted a video of sweeping a street with his friends in Mumbai.In 2017, he joined hands with Aditya Thackeray and sanitation workers to clean the Bandra Fort to contribute to Swachhata Hi Seva (cleanliness is service) campaign. In 2019, he was awarded the most effective Swachhta Ambassador by India Today Group's fifth edition of Safaigiri awards for using his popularity and fame to promote cleanliness and ensure the country achieves its goal of a Swachh Bharat.
            On the occasion of the World Nature Conservation day 2020, the cricketer took to twitter to spread message about the preservation of biodiversity.

        <h1>Rajya Sabha Member</h1>
        <h2 class="raj">In April 2012, Tendulkar accepted the Rajya Sabha nomination proposed by the President of India and became the first active sportsperson and cricketer to have been nominated. In 2019, Tendulkar contributed Rs. 22 lakh from his MPLAD funds allotted to him during his stint as Rajya Sabha MP for the renovation of a Children's Park in East Bandra. In the past six years as a Rajya Sabha MP, Sachin had drawn nearly Rs 90 lakh in salaries and other monthly allowances. He donated this entire salary and allowances to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund. The PMO has also issued a letter of acknowledgement which states: "Prime Minister acknowledges this thoughtful gesture and conveys his gratitude. These contributions will be of immense help in providing assistance to the persons in distress.</h2>
